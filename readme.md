You play as a nanobot doctor who enters virus-infected cells to heal them

However, the treatment isn't as easy as it seems – the viruses have mutated and can now fight back

Inside the pills are useful vitamins that improve your abilities and make you stronger. By breaking the pill and consuming the vitamins, the nanobot will gain the experience that is needed to level up. Experience can also be gained by killing enemies. After reaching the required amount of experience, you can choose an upgrade, but choose wisely - the wrong choice can lead to a quick defeat

Don't relax – the viruses are rapidly moving from cell to cell, destroying them! Luckily, you have a built-in locator that tracks the enemies. The arrow will point you in the direction you need to go, so hurry!
